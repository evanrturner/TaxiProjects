## Taxi data Project Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates my proficiency with Python to perform data analysis, and my ability to share insights and visualizations with non technical stakeholders.

This Folder contains jupyter notebooks and executive summaries for different stages of a project for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. I use Python and Tableau to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, compute Descriptive Statistics, perform an A/B test, and make visualizations to share with Data Analysis team members and NYC TLC stakeholders.
